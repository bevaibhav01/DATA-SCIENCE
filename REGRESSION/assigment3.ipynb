    "Q1. What is Ridge Regression, and how does it differ from ordinary least squares regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression, also known as L2 regularization, is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. It differs from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression primarily in how it handles the regression coefficients\n",
    "Ridge regression adds a penalty term proportional to the squared values of the coefficients (L2 norm) to the ordinary least squares loss function.\n",
    "The penalty term is controlled by a regularization parameter (alpha or lambda), which determines the strength of the regularization. A larger alpha leads to stronger regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling of Coefficients: Ridge regression adds a penalty term to shrink the coefficients towards zero, while OLS regression does not incorporate any regularization and estimates the coefficients solely based on minimizing the sum of squared errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prevention of Overfitting: Ridge regression helps prevent overfitting by reducing the variance of the coefficient estimates, especially when multicollinearity is present, whereas OLS regression may lead to overfitting in high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Ridge regression, OLS regression does not shrink the coefficients towards zero or address multicollinearity, which can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data.\n"

These assumptions are essential for the proper interpretation and application of the model. While some of the assumptions are similar to those of OLS regression, Ridge regression has additional considerations due to the regularization technique. Here are the key assumptions of Ridge regression:"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge regression is particularly well-suited for dealing with multicollinearity, a common issue in linear regression models where predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. In the presence of multicollinearity, ordinary least squares (OLS) regression can produce unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. However, Ridge regression can effectively mitigate the adverse effects of multicollinearity. Here's how Ridge regression performs in the presence of multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multicollinearity can lead to inflated standard errors and unstable coefficient estimates in OLS regression. Ridge regression addresses this issue by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, making them more stable and less sensitive to small changes in the data.\n",
    "By reducing the variance of the coefficient estimates, Ridge regression produces more reliable and interpretable results, even in the presence of multicollinearity."
