# Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?

# the abc module in Python stands for "Abstract Base Classes." It is a module that
# provides tools for defining abstract base classes. Abstract base classes allow
# you to define a common interface for a group of related classes without providing
# any concrete implementation. This concept is closely related to the concept of
# abstraction in object-oriented programming.
