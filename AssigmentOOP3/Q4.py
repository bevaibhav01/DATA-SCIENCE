# Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?

# Data abstraction can be achieved in Python through the use of abstract classes
# and interfaces provided by the abc module. Data abstraction focuses on hiding the
# implementation details of data and exposing only the essential attributes and
# methods to the outside world. This allows you to work with data at a higher level
# without knowing the internal complexities.
