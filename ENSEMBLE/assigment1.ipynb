    "Medical Diagnosis: Bayes' theorem is used in medical diagnosis to calculate the probability of a disease given certain symptoms. Doctors use prior knowledge of the prevalence of a disease and the likelihood of certain symptoms occurring to update the probability of a patient having that disease based on their symptoms.\n",
